# XmpTest
The Android Studio project file with XMPToolkit integrated (Experimental)

##Issues
- takes 5 mins or more to compile. Not very long but could be very annoying.
- compile fails sometime randomly because of multiple definitions of certain object/variable
- compile errors caused by compiling XMPCore and XMPFiles together (it seems there is no way to compile them separately)
